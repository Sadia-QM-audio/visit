This week, I created a web scraper to collect auction data from multiple auction websites. I used python libraries like BeautifulSoup, results, pandas and cvs to do web scraping and visualize the collected data.


I explored open access collections from museums around the world - the Rijksmuseum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the M+, and more. Many museums have made their vast collections of public domain artwork free for use, allowing anyone with an internet connection to view and utilize high-resolution images and metadata. People can use these services for education, research, commercial purposes, or for entertainment. The New York Public Library published an article online demonstrating how people can use works from their collection, including making GIFs! (Lampasone)[^1]

I was excited about working with the open access collections of different museums. I began by exploring what projects and services people have already created using them. I loved some of the games found on the [Google Arts and Culture website](https://artsandculture.google.com/), like the Art Coloring Book, where users can color famous pieces of art as they like, and Pet Portrait, which compares photographs of one's pet to that of an animal in a painting! I also loved seeing then-and-now comparisons by different museums, which show how different a location looked in the past. You can check out some [here](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/then-and-now)!

<!-- I came up with several ideas for projects that could utilize open source collections, like viewing works from a particular era, using AI to identify objects in different paintings, graphing the popularity of different mediums over time, etc.  -->

I worked on creating a website that could show the timeline of an artist's works. It uses the open access APIs of [The Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/) and the [Cleveland Museum of Art](https://www.clevelandart.org/) (CMA). The APIs are used to collect information about the works made by a particular artist, and create a timeline.

The API of the Met and CMA have different structures, so I used two separate functions to query data. I began by working using the Met's API, which conveniently has a function for searching for artists. However, I soon found that any artist whose name contains matching words are included in the returned result. For example, if I searched for 'Vincent van Gogh', I would get works from him along with other artists with 'vincent' or 'van' in their name. So, I added some conditions so that the results would be filtered correctly. This is an example of the working filter:

    <!---
    <figcaption>Caption for the image.</figcaption>
    --->

</figure>

I then worked on fetching data from the Cleveland Museum of Art's API in a similar way. After combining the two and experimenting a bit, I noticed that not all works display images. This is probably because some works are protected by copyright law. However, basic information about the works is still displayed, so I decided to keep them in the timeline.

There are a few limitations of the website. The main problem is that it does not work if I search using a keyword that does not match the value returned by the API precisely. For example, if I search for 'Henry Edmond Cross' instead of 'Henry-Edmond Cross', I do not get the expected results. This applies to accent marks too. Another drawback is that if there are a lot of pieces in the museum's collection, it takes a fairly long time to generate the timeline - up to a minute or more!

Here are some snippets of the timelines generated using my project for different artists:
