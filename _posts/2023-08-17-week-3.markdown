This week, I worked on creating a publication for the exhibition Tales of A Connected World using Quire. [Quire](https://quire.getty.edu/) is an open-source tool created by [Getty](https://www.getty.edu/) that allows the same set of files to be used for creating a website, pdf, and epub.

You can view the pdf <a href="img/portfolio/week-3/quire-final.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

Creating a new quire project automatically uses files from the quire starter default repository, which can be viewed on this [page](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-starter-default).

I loved using quire, because it simplifies adding different types of media, including image carousels, icons, audio, and video files. This is also the first time I have created an ebook, something I never thought I would do, so I felt really happy about working on this project.

Another advantage of working with Quire is that it supports multiple languages. I have tried adding Arabic text, and it worked without any issues. The only problem is that quire is built to support primarily English, so all text elements are aligned left-to-right. While plaintext content can be changed into right-to-left alignment easily, it is difficult to do so for metadata. I think that it would not be difficult to implement such a change, but it would be quite time-consuming and require some trial and error.

I started this project by reading through quire's documentation and watching a video tutorial. However, I quickly ran into a problem - I got errors when I ran ==quire build== command, which is necessary to ensure that pdf and epub can be created. I visited [Quire's Community Forum](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/discussions) and found that it is a common bug in Windows, and implemented the workaround suggested.

The generated pdf did not have any images, aside from the cover image and a few others. By default, [paged.js](https://pagedjs.org/) is used to generate pdf. Quire's docs suggested an alternative approach of using [PrinceXML](https://www.princexml.com/) to generate the pdf, which I hoped would fix the issue. However, pdfs generated by both libraries did not display images. 

To find a solution, I read through the relevant parts of Quire's documentation as well as their forum, and tried different approaches to solve the problem. I found a potential answer - using html tags directly instead of shortcodes. But that displayed the images only on the pdf, not on the website. Moreover, I wanted to use quire's built-in resources, like image carousels. If I switched to using html tags, I would have to implement everything myself, which would make using Quire pointless.

I have submitted a request for help on the forum, and received a prompt response, so I hope a solution can be found soon.
