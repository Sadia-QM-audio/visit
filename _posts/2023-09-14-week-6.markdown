I explored how Power Automate can be used to combine the use of multiple Microsoft Services. My primary task was to see how data collected using a form could be stored, visualized, and shared.

Users filling in the form can submit their email. Since there are multiple forms, it was necessary to set up a system so that the same email address is not stored multiple times. Using Power Automate, it is quite easy to add data to an Excel file. In addition, it is possible to read all data in a table, and check if any existing emails match the new email. So, if there are no duplicates, the new email is added to the Excel sheet.

My next objective was to create a visualization of people's answers to a question, then show it with anyone who filled in the form. For this, I first created a chart in Power BI using the data collected from the form. Howver, I found that publishing reports on the internet is a Pro feature. As I am a free user, I cannot share reports online.

I opted to use Excel again for the visualization. I found a very helpful tutorial by DamoBird365, linked [here](https://www.damobird365.com/awesome-create-charts-via-office-scripts/), which shows how scripts can be used to automatically generate charts based on existing data. I tested this by creating a workflow to send myself emails whenever anyone filled in the form.
