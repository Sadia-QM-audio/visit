Hii, still writing it


This week, I built an audio guide for Lusail Museum by using the audio guide template published by ACMI Labs. The repository for the original audio guide can be found [here](https://github.com/ACMILabs/static-museum-audio-guide).

You can check out my website by scanning this QR code or clicking this [link](https://sadia-qm-audio.github.io/static-museum-audio-guide/welcome/)

When a visitor opens the website, they are greeted by a welcome page with simple instructions for using the audio guide. Then they are taken to the home page, which allows them to choose between 2 languages - English and Arabic, and choose which audio track to listen to. They are then taken to the page for the selected audio track, which contains the track and a transcript. They can switch to another track using the audio player, or the side menu.

## My experience developing the audio guide

At first, I went through the documentation on ACMILabs' Github repository, which explains the general setup and layout of components in a clear, concise manner. I do not have much experience with forking exisiting repositories and working on them, so perusing their documentation and going through their source code was very helpful. I also opened the live demo website, and compared it to the source-code to familiarize myself with how different components are arranged, which was quite helpful later on for cutomizing the website's appearance.
