This week, I built an audio guide for Lusail Museum by using the audio guide template published by ACMI Labs. The repository for the original audio guide can be found [here](https://github.com/ACMILabs/static-museum-audio-guide).

You can check out my website by scanning this QR code or clicking this [link](https://sadia-qm-audio.github.io/static-museum-audio-guide/welcome/)

When a visitor opens the website, they are greeted by a welcome page with simple instructions for using the audio guide. Then they are taken to the home page, which allows them to choose between 2 languages - English and Arabic, and choose which audio track to listen to. They are then taken to the page for the selected audio track, which contains the track and a transcript. They can switch to another track using the audio player, or the side menu.

#### My experience developing the audio guide

At first, I went through the documentation on ACMILabs' Github repository, which explains the general setup and layout of components in a clear, concise manner. I do not have much experience with forking existing repositories and working on them, so perusing their documentation and going through their source code was very helpful. I also opened the live demo website, and compared it to the source code to familiarize myself with how different components are arranged, which was quite helpful later on for customizing the website's appearance.

I extracted audio files from several videos using VLC Media Player for this project. I began by setting up the page for the first audio track. This included adding a title, transcript of the audio file and images.

I did some trial and error, but eventually, the page looked as it should. I then added some more audio track pages in a similar fashion.

The next feature I wanted to incorporate is giving users the choice to switch between English and Arabic. I did so by including buttons on the home page that takes users to the corresponding language's homepage. The homepage then displays only the audio tracks in the user's chosen language.

This solution is not perfect, but the other attempts I made at establishing this feature were not successful. At first, I tried to use javascript to switch between languages. The advantage of using javascript is that it would allow me to easily modify the site's behaviour by simply changing the value of a variable. However, none of the approaches that I tried worked. So, I used a simpler solution - buttons that link to another page. 

Finally, I tested some features to make sure everything was functioning properly. To make sharing the website easier, I generated QR codes for several pages. Later, I shared the website with several of my colleagues and got their feedback. 

Some pictures of the completed website:

I truly enjoyed working on this project, and hope you like the audio guide!
